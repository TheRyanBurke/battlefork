Battle for Koprulu

BfK is an on-going territory-based tournament for a group of players.

Tournament Overview
- Teams battle for territory in the Koprulu solar system
- Any team which loses its capital world is eliminated
- Worlds are connected in a node graph
- Each world represents a map in SC2
- Teams also own three race homeworlds. Loss of these worlds disables that race for selection in matches.  Homeworlds are pre-designated on the system map.
 -- Or will Captains designate them??

Tournament Start
- Establish # of players
- Decide on # of teams
- Pick 1 Captain for each team
- Assign remaining players via draft or random
- Captains place each player in a controlled world on the system map

Round of Play
- Captains choose all player movements
- All team movements are revealed at once, when compiled by referee
- Players have a limited amount of time to get together and play the match
- Territory is gained/lost as determined by the matches played

System Movement
- Captains assign new locations for each player on his/her team
- Players may be moved to any adjacent world on the node graph
- If the destination world is already owned by that team, the player may be moved one additional time this round
- Captains may not send more players to a world than the maximum # of players the world supports
- All movements are chosen by Captains, then revealed simultaneously on the system map
- Movements are revealed as a team color and # of players in that move.  Player names are not known until it is time to play the match.
- All movements for a round are considered simultaneous

Playing a Match
- Opposing players on the same planet after the move phase must play a game of SC2
- The contested planet determines the map to be played
- Host is assigned as convenient
- Players may choose random race if all race homeworlds are secure, or pick any race as determined by secured homeworlds
 -- Enforce captains to play as random???
- One game is played to determine winner, standard ladder settings and victory conditions 
- Players report match results to their Captains and to the system map referee
- The match loser retreats to a connected world that the team owns at the *end* of the round. If the losing player cannot make a valid retreat, the player is eliminated from the tournament.

Koprulu Worlds
- Koprulu worlds are connected in a pre-determined node graph
- Players can be moved between worlds as they are connected in the graph
- Worlds have an assigned map and maximum player count per team
- Worlds are either a team capital world, a race homeworld, or standard world
- The only benefit of controlling a standard world is for the movement bonus
 -- Could there be a system vision maximum of n+1 on the node graph???
- There is no benefit to owning an additional capital world or an additional race homeworld of a given type 
 -- Could there be a race-specific benefit per race homeworld? Like a mass recall to capital if P world is still owned

Tournament End
- A team is eliminated when they lose their capital world, or all three race homeworlds
- Last team standing wins!
