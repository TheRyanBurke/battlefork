<h1>About Battlefork</h1>

<p>
First off, thanks for checking out Battlefork! It is with great pleasure that
I am able to bring this app to you.
</p>
<p>
So what is this? In short, it's an online strategy game. There's a board,
places to occupy, and pieces to move around.  Except in this game, your pieces
are your team mates! 
</p>
<p>
Two teams battle for control of a sector of space.  Each team starts with all
players on their homeworld.  Once a round, team captains can issue orders to
their team mates to advance them around the map, one planet at a time.  When
all orders are submit, the engine will determine if any planet is contested,
meaning players from opposing teams are occupying the same planet.  
</p>
<p>
When this occurs, those players will be marked as in a battle and they will
need to play a game (preferably Starcraft 2, but really, any game) and report
the result themselves via the web app, or have their team captain report it.
</p>
<p>
When all battles are resolved for a round, captains can input orders for the
next one.  Play continues until one team loses their homeworld!
</p>

<b>Constraints for 1.0</b>
<ol>
<li>Teams must have 4 players before they can challenge another team or receive challenges.</li>
<li>Max team size is 4 players for now, but I will lift that restriction before 2.0</li>
<li>Team captains manually add players to their team. There is no invite/confirmation process in place.</li>
<li>There is no interface to undo or rewind actions. All movement orders and battle results are final.</li>
<li>The site is unsecure right now.  Passwords are encrypted, but there is still a lot of stuff wide open with manual URL input that I'm using for development and testing purposes.  If you are interested in using the app in this early state, please limit your interactions to the links available on the page.</li>
</ol>
